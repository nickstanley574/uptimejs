<h2>About uptimejs</h2>
<p>
    Uptimejs is inspired by uptime.is.
    I made this because uptime.is stats "As of 2022-11-14 uptime.is is powered by Python and Flask" Which I found a little strange since that mean the website had a server.
    I thought that this is a prefect example how a a simple website using arthmitic and didn't need to managed state could be be a "static-application" using only html and javascript to accomplish the same task.
</p>

<p>
    I created this with two design goals. 1. Make a near clone of uptime.is using only html and javascript with similar features, including the api and 2. make sure hosting costs were as $0.
</p>

<h2>API endpoint and HTTP method</h2>

<p>
    The uptime.is API is available at TODO using the GET method (POST is not supported). 
</p>

<p>
    The SLA uptime percentage is specified as a parameter named sla.
