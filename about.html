<h2>About uptimejs</h2>
<p>
    Uptimejs is a re-implementation / copy cat of uptime.is. I made this because uptime.is stats "As of 2022-11-14 uptime.is is powered by Python and Flask" Which I found a little strange since that mean the website had a server. I thought that this is a prefect example how a a simple website using arthmitic and didn't need to managed state could be be a "static-application" using only html and javascript to accomplish the same task.
